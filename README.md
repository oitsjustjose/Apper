# Apper
A tool for making Weblink Shortcuts into macOS Applications

Normally, you can save a web shortcut to your desktop in macOS no problem!

Unfortunately, macOS saves this as a .webloc file, so you can't put it next to your favorite apps in the Dock.

Apper creates a .app file for you JUST FOR THAT!

# Usage
Very simple:
1. Unzip
2. Open Terminal, and cd to the folder: <code> cd [path to apper] </code>.
<br>This can also be done by typing "cd" and then dragging the Apper folder into the Terminal window
3. In Terminal, type: <code>bash apper.sh [URL] [App Name]</code>
<br>URL can be any site, just should have the http:// or https:// portion
<br>App Name can be any name, but **must not contain any spaces**.
4. Follow [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0gTdRTwEn4) for the icon.

# Compatibility
For macOS only - haven't tested on anything older than macOS Sierra 10.12.4

App should work regardless, as it's a CLI program using basic UNIX commands
